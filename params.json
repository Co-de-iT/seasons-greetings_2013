However, their work provided a big help in finding bugs and developing the whole thing.\r\n \r\n---\r\n \r\n### instructions\r\n \r\n + start with CTRL+SHIFT+R (or Sketch > Present)\r\n + press: \r\n + .. space bar to start/stop animation\r\n + .. 'r' to reset branching \r\n + .. 'w' to switch hormon distribution between flower and logo\r\n + .. 'a' to show/hide branch-hormon connection\r\n + .. 'h' to show/hide hormons before branches reach them (try this before running the animation)\r\n + .. 's' to save a screenshot (you'll find it in your desktop in the /Co-de-iT_images folder)\r\n + .. 'd' to save a pdf fil of the branching (you'll find it in your desktop in the /Co-de-iT_pdf folder)\r\n \r\n \r\n---\r\n \r\n### options\r\n \r\n + place your image instad of the Co-de-iT logo in the /data folder: for best results, images should be\r\n   black and white, hormons will look for dark places\r\n\r\n + feel free to improve anywhere you see the chance to.
