# Season's Greetings_2013
Co-de-iT season's greetings and Happy Holidays for 2013!
_code written by Alessio Erioli - Co-de-iT_
 
### code history:
 
+ the code is an implementation of a branching system seeking "hormons" in space inspired by the "Hyphae" work of nervous system - https://vimeo.com/25604611
+ a version was developed by Niccolò Ciuppani, Nicola Fuzzi and Alessia Masini for the 2013 a3 course at the University of Bologna; I helped with a few issues but then decided to re-write the code myself from scratch. However, their work provided a big help in finding bugs and developing the whole thing.
